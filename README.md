# IOT_Based_Health_Monitoring_System

Problem statement:
Heart diseases are becoming a big issue for the last few decades and many people die because of certain health problems. By analyzing or monitoring the ECG signal at the initial stage and heart rate this disease can be prevented. So we present this project, ECG Monitoring. The measurement of pulse rate or heartbeat is a very common medical procedure. Quite often, the patient kept under observation is essentially monitored via their pulse/heartbeat rate.
Pulse rate varies from person to person. The pulse is lower when we are resting because at that time, the body does not need much oxygen, and the heart can pump blood at a lower rate to fulfill the oxygen required by the body. The pulse rises when we exercise or are under stress. This is because the body requires more oxygen during these times and, therefore, requires more blood to pump through it to meet the oxygen requirement. The normal pulse rate for children ranges from 70 to ~100 beats per minute. The normal pulse rate for adults is 60 to ~100 beats per minute.

Objective:
The Internet  of Things  is considered  now  as one of  the  feasible  solutions  for  any  remote  value tracking  especially  in  the  field  of  health monitoring.  In  this  paper,  an  IoT  based  health monitoring  system  was  developed.  The  system monitored body  pulse  rate and  oxygen  saturation using  sensors,  which  are  also  displayed  on  an LCD.  These  sensor  values  are  then  sent  to  the App and also creates an IP address if required.by entering these calculated values in the website we can predict heart disease.

An IoT based health monitoring system was developed.  The system monitored body pulse rate, body temperature and ECG using sensors. The main objectives of the work:

	To design a portable home based Tele-Health monitoring system for elderly patient.
	Transmission of digital data of the physical parameters and its analysis using wireless communications.
	All the sensors can monitor simultaneously and sends the results to the authenticated person.
	Provide medical assistance according to the data received i.e. heart rate, ECG, body temperature.
  

Features:
	 Here are some special features of my project.
	1. Patients heart rate measurement.
	2. Patients body temperature measurement.
	3. Patients ECG measurement.
	4. All the data about the patients can be send doctor or can be store in cloud-based system, then alert the patient.

There are three sensor ECG sensor, Body Temperature sensor and Heart Rate sensor each of them will connected with the human body. Each of the sensor will retrieve the data from human body and pass it to the Arduino UNO to generate analog to digital signal. When the data is completely processed it will send the data through ESP8286 to the database or cloud storage. Then the doctor or the patient can see the condition of the heart and body.
